# Qwiklab 3 - Momentum Strategy

## Running

First, at the command-line prompt, type in the following command and press Enter.
```
git clone https://github.com/Auquan/Tutorials.git
```

Then Navigate to the **Tutorials** directory and open **momentum_backtest_losing_money.ipynb.**.

You'll need to install some libraries to complete the notebook. Create a new cell at the top of the notebook and execute the following code:

```
%pip install pandas==0.24.1 --user
%pip install tensorboardX --user
%pip install bs4 --user
%pip install -U auquan_toolbox --user
```
If you get stuck, open the solution file **momentum_backtest_making_money.ipynb** I have uploaded.
