# Build a ML Model in TensorFlow using the Estimator API

## About
This lab is based on Qwiklabs Supported by Google Cloud Platform(GCP).

Main Webpage for Qwiklabs: https://www.qwiklabs.com/

In this lab, I build and evaluate a simple linear regression model in TensorFlow using the Esitimator API to predict AAPL stock prices.

Estimators are a part of the high-level TensorFlow APIs which are interchangeable and allow users to test many standard pre-made estimators models in quick succession.
